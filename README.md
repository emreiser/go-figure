### A Comparative look at Countries through Human Development Statistics

[See Go Figure live on Heroku](http://go-figure.herokuapp.com/)

Go Figure was designed to explore our perceptions of how countries stack up against one another through the lens of the Human Development Report indicators.

The site engages viewers through a series of questions comparing countries' ranks in several key areas from gender equality and IT to health and education and tracks users' bias through their responses.
